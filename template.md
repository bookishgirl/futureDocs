# Filling in the new Project Card

This is what the template asks you for currently (are there other questions or things we should include).

We will attach “members” to this card for anyone who will work on the project.

The first card represents the first step in the project. You will use the step headers laid out in our workflow in parens after your project title to indicate which step it will begin on (like Origination but maybe in some cases not).

Because when we schedule the project we might want to line up a series of steps over the course of a series of months - we will make copies of the card and change out the workflow designation - that way we can map out the entirety of a project and assign the right people to the right steps and just see it all “at a glance”
