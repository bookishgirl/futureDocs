# Creating a new Project Card

* Click on the first card in the "New" column (left-most column)
* Choose "Create card from template" (the green button at the top right)

# Filling in the new Project Card

1. Give your project a name and add the workflow step in parentheses after your project name to indicate which step it will begin on (likely [Origination](dcworkflow#Origination) but maybe in some cases not).
2. In the Description section, please add the following information:
    1. Desired outcome for the project
    2. An approximate number of objects and type of object
    3. Do you want to digitize this in-house or is this a candidate for vendor digitization?
    4. What is your funding source?
    5. Are there any grant or internal requirements or deadlines?
    6. What platform(s) do you intend to use?
This is what the template asks you for currently (are there other questions or things we should include).

We will attach “members” to this card for anyone who will work on the project.

The first card represents the first step in the project. 

Because when we schedule the project we might want to line up a series of steps over the course of a series of months - we will make copies of the card and change out the workflow designation - that way we can map out the entirety of a project and assign the right people to the right steps and just see it all “at a glance”
