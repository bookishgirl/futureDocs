# Digital Collections project workflow

This is the doc site for proposing a new project to Digital Collections.
Proposals go to the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/3hIHB3u0/dcc-calendar) where you can also keep up to date as to what projects are underway.

Currently only members of the Digital Collections Committee can add new proposals.

If you are not a member of the committee and are interested in proposing a project, please work with a member of the committee to do so.
